# Helio's Automations
This is a list of small scripts I have made to make my life easier and avoid a lot of repetitive tasks. These are intended for my own personal use, so they are not exactly "user-friendly," but free to ask if you need help using them or installing dependencies!
## List of scripts and what they do:
* DLsiteMetadataDownloader.py: Given a DLsite RJ code, this script will scrap the metadata for the product page and apply it to the mp3 files. This is intended for music or voice dramas.
